# Project Scenario
* You are provided with a dataset of a departmental store.
* It contains details of products from May, 2020, a period marked by covid-19.
* Your manager wants you to find out that investing in which products will be more profitable.
* Your objective is to analyse the patterns and trends of the products, and gather insights for 
  strategic decision making.(At this level, you donâ€™t need to make reports/recommendations now.
* You will build reports and make recommendations in future, with the knowledge you gained from 
  this project.)
